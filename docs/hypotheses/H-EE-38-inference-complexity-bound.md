# H-EE-38: R=1 Inference Complexity is O(n log n)

## Hypothesis

> The inference complexity of an R=1 architecture is bounded by O(n log n) per token, where n is sequence length. This is optimal: no intelligent inference can be done in O(n) (too simple) or needs O(n^2) (wasteful). FFT attention + Phi6 activation achieve this bound.

## Background

- Standard attention: O(n^2) per token
- FFT-Mix attention (technique 8): O(n log n)
- Phi6Simple activation: O(1) per element (4 FLOPs vs GELU's 14)
- Combined: O(n log n) for the full forward pass
- Comparison: FFT itself is O(n log n), sorting is O(n log n)
- Conjecture: n log n is the fundamental complexity of "structured information processing"

## Predictions

1. O(n log n) attention achieves >= 95% quality of O(n^2) attention
2. O(n) attention (linear) sacrifices quality on long-range dependencies
3. The quality gap between O(n log n) and O(n^2) shrinks as model quality increases
4. At R=1, the O(n log n) bound is tight (can't do better without losing quality)

## Conclusion

H-EE-38: Complexity-theoretic bound on intelligent inference. O(n log n) as the "speed of thought."
