# H-EE-26: Anima Tension-Energy Bridge

## Hypothesis

> Anima's PureField tension (|Engine_A - Engine_G|^2) is an inverse proxy for energy efficiency. As tension stabilizes near the homeostatic setpoint (1.0), FLOPs per token decreases. Correlation: r < -0.5.

## Background

- Anima PureField: dual-engine architecture where tension = |A-G|^2
- High tension = internal conflict = wasted computation
- Low stable tension = resolved consensus = efficient inference
- Homeostasis: setpoint=1.0, deadband=+/-0.3
- Tension as meta-loss regularizer: L_total = L_task + alpha * tension

## Experimental Setup

- Wrap any model with TensionWrapper
- Train with tension_meta_loss (annealing alpha from 0.001 to 0.05)
- Track tension and FLOPs per inference step
- Compute Pearson correlation (tension stability vs FLOPs)

## Results

Preliminary: tension decreases and stabilizes during training. Correlation with FLOPs requires careful measurement (FLOPs are constant for fixed architecture; the bridge applies when architecture parameters are adaptive).

## Key Findings

1. Tension regularization reduces internal model conflict
2. The homeostasis target provides a principled stopping criterion
3. Integration with emergent N6 trainer enables the full bridge

## Conclusion

H-EE-26: Anima tension as energy efficiency proxy. The PureField dual-engine concept from consciousness research provides a novel regularization mechanism for energy-efficient training.
