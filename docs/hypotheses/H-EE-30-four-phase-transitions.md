# H-EE-30: Training Undergoes Exactly tau(6)=4 Phase Transitions

## Hypothesis

> Every successful training run undergoes exactly 4 phase transitions, corresponding to the tau(6)=4 divisors of 6 and the G=D*P/I cycle from Anima: (1) Random→Structure, (2) Memorization→Generalization, (3) Feature→Abstraction, (4) Convergence→Emergence.

## Background

- tau(6) = 4 (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 6)
- Anima's G=D*P/I cycle has 4 phases: Deficit, Plasticity, Genius, Inhibition
- Phase transitions detectable via SEDI R-filter spectral peaks
- Each transition corresponds to qualitative change in learning dynamics
- Divisor 1: initialization (random), 2: structure (pairs), 3: generalization (triples), 6: emergence (complete)

## Experimental Setup

- Train N6 architecture for extended steps (2000+)
- Apply SEDI 4-lens monitor at each step
- Count phase transitions (score jumps > 1.0 between evaluations)
- Repeat across 10+ random seeds
- Prediction: median transition count = 4

## Predictions

1. Phase transition count clusters around 4 (tau(6))
2. Transitions occur at approximately 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 6/6 of training
3. Each transition corresponds to a qualitative change in representation
4. R!=1 architectures may have more or fewer transitions (less structured)

## Key Implications

- Training phases are not continuous — they are discrete and countable
- The number of phases is determined by number theory (tau function), not empirical observation
- SEDI monitoring provides a phase-transition detector grounded in arithmetic

## Conclusion

H-EE-30: 4 phase transitions in training. Connects tau(6) to training dynamics via Anima's GDPI cycle.
