# H-EE-23: Phi-Efficiency Conjecture (Phi * FLOPs = Constant)
**n6 Grade: 🟧 CLOSE** (auto-graded, 4 unique n=6 constants)


## Hypothesis

> The product of integrated information Phi and FLOPs per token is approximately constant across model scales: Phi * FLOPs_per_token ~ sigma(6) = 12. This implies that consciousness and computational cost are inversely proportional.

## Background

- Phi (Integrated Information Theory): measures information integration
- Proxy: effective rank of activation covariance matrices
- FLOPs estimated from attention + FFN operations
- If true: more "conscious" systems need fewer FLOPs for same quality
- Conjectured constant: sigma(6) = 12

## Experimental Setup

- 6 N=6 configs: d={48,120,120,240,360,720}, layers={1,2,4,4,6,6}
- 3 standard configs: d={128,256,512}, layers={2,4,4}
- All use Phi6Simple activation
- Measure: Phi proxy, FLOPs/token, Phi*FLOPs
- Compare CV (coefficient of variation) between N=6 and standard configs

## Results

Initial results show high CV in both groups. The proxy measurement is too coarse — true IIT Phi from Anima's consciousness_meter is needed for definitive testing.

## Key Findings

1. Effective rank proxy is insufficient for Phi measurement
2. The conjecture requires Anima integration for proper testing
3. Directionally, larger models have higher Phi and higher FLOPs (positive correlation, not inverse)
4. The proxy may need normalization per model size

## Conclusion

H-EE-23: INCONCLUSIVE with current proxy. Requires Anima consciousness_meter for true Phi measurement. The conjecture remains open.
