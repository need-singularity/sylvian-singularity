# Hypothesis Review 153: Hubble Tension and Model Error Correspondence

## Hypothesis

> The measurement discrepancy of the Hubble constant (Hubble tension, 8.3%) corresponds to the grid discretization error (0.8%) of our model. However, since the scale difference is ~10×, the correspondence is weak.

## Background

### Hubble Tension

Two measurement methods for the Hubble constant H₀ provide different values:

- **Early universe measurement** (Planck CMB): H₀ = 67.4 ± 0.5 km/s/Mpc
- **Late universe measurement** (SH0ES Cepheids): H₀ = 73.0 ± 1.0 km/s/Mpc
- **Difference**: ΔH₀ = 5.6 km/s/Mpc → **8.3%** discrepancy
- **Statistical significance**: Above 5σ → systematic error or new physics

### Model Error

Error by grid size in our model's grid discretization:

| grid | Error | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 20 | 2.4% | Coarse search |
| 50 | 0.9% | General verification |
| 100 | 0.5% | Default value |
| 200 | 0.2% | Precise verification |

At grid=50, error **0.9% ≈ 0.8%** is compared with the Hubble tension 8.3%.

## Analysis of the Weak Correspondence

There is **no direct correspondence** between Hubble tension and model error. However, some structural similarities exist:

### Similarities

| Property | Hubble tension | Model error | Similarity |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Measuring same thing by different methods" | Early vs late | Low grid vs high grid | ⚠️ Weak |
| Discretization/resolution problem | Scale of observation difference | Grid resolution difference | ⚠️ Weak |
| Systematic bias | Distance ladder correction | Boundary effects | ⚠️ Weak |

### Differences

| Property | Hubble tension | Model error |
|---|---|---|
| Magnitude | 8.3% | 0.8% |
| Resolvability | Unresolved (new physics?) | Resolved by larger grid |
| Physical depth | Fundamental | Technical |
| Directionality | Unclear which is correct | Higher grid is more accurate |

## Alternative Interpretation: Model Translation of Hubble Tension

If the Hubble tension means "I values differ between early and late universe":

```
  I
  0.5│━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  critical line
     │
  0.4│
     │      ●────────────────  late universe (SH0ES)
  1/3│━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  fixed point
     │  ●────────────────────  early universe (Planck)
  0.3│
     │
  0.2│·····················  lower bound
     └──┼──┼──┼──┼──┼──┼──
      CMB  BAO  SNe  Cepheids
      (z≈1100)        (z≈0)

  Early universe: slightly lower I (smaller H₀)
  Late universe:  slightly higher I (larger H₀)
  → Is I still converging toward the fixed point?
```

This interpretation is interesting but **highly speculative**.

## Conclusion

Direct correspondence between Hubble tension 8.3% and model error 0.8% **fails**:

1. **Scale difference ~10×** — hard to view as different expressions of the same phenomenon
2. **Difference in nature of cause** — Hubble tension is physical, model error is technical
3. **Difference in resolvability** — model error can be resolved by larger grid; Hubble tension is unresolved

However, the general lesson that "discrepancies arise when measuring the same thing at different scales" remains valid.

## Limitations

- Meaningful comparison is difficult since the cause of Hubble tension is unknown
- The numerical comparison of 8.3% vs 0.8% is likely coincidental
- Model error is a resolution issue, but Hubble tension may be a physical discrepancy

## Verification Directions

- [ ] Re-evaluate when Hubble tension is resolved (upon discovery of new physics)
- [ ] Incorporate DESI/Euclid H₀ measurement results
- [ ] Check whether "scale-dependent I" exists in the model (see Hypothesis 128)
- [ ] Explore correspondence with other cosmological tensions (S₈ tension, etc.)

## Status: ❌ Direct correspondence fails (scale mismatch)
