# H-EE-24: Clausius Information Inequality

## Hypothesis

> The information-theoretic analog of Clausius inequality holds: Delta_H_model + Delta_H_data >= 0, with equality if and only if the architecture operates at R=1 (n=6 ratios). R=1 architectures achieve reversible (zero-waste) information processing.

## Background

- Clausius inequality (thermodynamics): Delta_S_system + Delta_S_environment >= 0
- Information analog: entropy change in model + entropy change in data >= 0
- Equality (reversible process): all information from data captured in model
- R(6)=1 is the unique reversibility condition among n >= 2
- Measured via gradient distribution entropy + output distribution entropy

## Experimental Setup

- Track gradient entropy and output entropy per training step
- Compare sum (Delta_H_model + Delta_H_data) across R-score levels
- Prediction: sum approaches 0 at R~1.0, positive at R<1

## Results

Theoretical framework established. Experimental verification requires careful entropy measurement infrastructure.

## Key Findings

1. The Clausius analog provides a thermodynamic interpretation of R=1
2. Irreversible architectures (R<1) waste information as "computational heat"
3. This bridges Landauer's principle with neural architecture design

## Conclusion

H-EE-24: Theoretical framework for information thermodynamics of neural architectures. Links R(6)=1 to reversible computation via Clausius inequality.
