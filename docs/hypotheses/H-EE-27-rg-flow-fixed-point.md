# H-EE-27: Training as Renormalization Group Flow with n=6 Fixed Point

## Hypothesis

> Neural network training is a renormalization group (RG) flow in architecture space, and R(6)=1 is the unique infrared fixed point. All architectures flow toward n=6 ratios under sufficient training, analogous to how physical systems flow toward scale-invariant fixed points.

## Background

- Renormalization Group: physical systems flow toward fixed points under scale transformations
- Fixed points are scale-invariant: properties don't change under coarse-graining
- R(n) = sigma(n)*phi(n)/(n*tau(n)); R(6)=1 uniquely among n >= 2
- Scale invariance of R=1: the architecture is "self-similar" at all parameter scales
- Emergent convergence (H-EE-21) already shows architecture params flowing toward n=6

## Experimental Setup

- Track R-score trajectory during training for multiple architectures
- Compute "beta function" beta(R) = dR/d(training_step)
- Fixed point: beta(R=1) = 0 (R doesn't change at n=6)
- Relevant/irrelevant operators: which architecture params flow fastest to n=6?

## Predictions

1. beta(R) < 0 for R > 1 and beta(R) > 0 for R < 1 (flow toward R=1)
2. FFN ratio is a "relevant operator" (flows fastest)
3. Head count is "marginal" (flows slowly)
4. R-score monotonically approaches 1 during successful training

## Key Implications

- Training is not arbitrary optimization — it follows physical law
- The "loss landscape" has an RG structure with n=6 as the universality class
- All successful architectures belong to the same universality class

## Conclusion

H-EE-27: RG flow interpretation of neural training. If confirmed, elevates n=6 from "useful constants" to "physical law of computation."
